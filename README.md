# go-simple-wav-example
An example of doing some Wav file writing using Golang.

A partial implementation of [wav specification](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html).

The example is for creating PCM little endian wav file using [pcm generator](https://github.com/ik5/gen_pcm) I wrote.

Please note that there great Golang implementations for .WAV format that recommended to use.
This example shows how to generate a simple .WAV file rather than replacing the good pacakges.
